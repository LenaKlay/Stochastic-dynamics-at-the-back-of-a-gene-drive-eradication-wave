# Stochastic dynamics at the back of a gene drive eradication wave

## Introduction

Artificial gene drive is a genetic engineering technology that could be used for the control of natural populations. Gene drive alleles bias their own transmission and can therefore spread in a population within a relatively small number of generations, even if they are deleterious. Understanding the potential outcomes of this technology, including the modification and/or the eradication of a natural population, is essential before real-world applications are considered. Here is the code supporting the analyses presented in the paper “Stochastic dynamics at the back of a gene drive eradication wave”.
